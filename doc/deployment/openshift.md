# OpenShift

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) is a popular enterprise Kubernetes distribution.  Pachyderm can run on OpenShift with a few small tweaks in the deployment process, which will be outlined below.

### Deploy Pachyderm

1. How you deploy Pachyderm on OpenShift is largely going to depend on where OpenShift is deployed. 

* OpenShift Deployed on [AWS](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/amazon_web_services.html) 
* OpenShift Deployed on [GCP](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/google_cloud_platform.html)
* OpenShift Deployed on [Azure](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/azure.html)
* OpenShift Deployed [on-premise](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/on_premises.html)


2. Replace `hostPath` with `emptyDir` in your cluster manifest (Your manifest is generated by the `pachctl deploy ...` command or can be generated manually. To only generate the manifest, run `pachctl deploy ...` with the `--dry-run` flag).

    ```
          "spec": {
            "volumes": [
              {
                "name": "pach-disk",
                "emptyDir": {}
              }
            ],

     ... <snip>  ...

          "spec": {
            "volumes": [
              {
                "name": "etcd-storage",
                "emptyDir": {}
              }
            ],
    ```

    Please note that `emptyDir` does not persist your data. You need to configure persistent volume or hostPath to persist your data.


3. Deploy Pachyderm manifest you modified.

    ```sh
    $ oc create -f pachyderm.json
    ```

    You can see the cluster status by using `oc get pods` as in upstream Kubernetes:

    ```sh
    $ oc get pods
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    dash-6c9dc97d9c-89dv9    2/2       Running   0          1m
    etcd-0                   1/1       Running   0          4m
    pachd-65fd68d6d4-8vjq7   1/1       Running   0          4m
    ```

### Configure your cluster to run pipelines

1. Add `cluster-reader` and `edit` role to `pachyderm` service account:

    ```sh
    $ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
    $ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:<PROJECT_NAME>:pachyderm
    ```

2. Add the `pachyderm` service account to the pipeline Pod (ReplicationController).

    ```
    oc patch rc pipeline-edges-v1 -p 'spec:
      template:
        spec:
          serviceAccount: pachyderm
          serviceAccountName: pachyderm'
    ```

    or manually edit rc `oc edit rc <RC_PIPELINE> -o json`:

    ```
                   ...
                "dnsPolicy": "ClusterFirst",
                "serviceAccountName": "pachyderm",
                "serviceAccount": "pachyderm",
                "securityContext": {}
                   ...
    ```

3. Replace `hostPath` with `emptyDir`.  Again, please note that `emptyDir` does not persist your data. You need to configure persistent volume or hostPath to persist.

4. Redeploy the updated Pods.

    ```sh
    $ oc scale rc pipeline-edges-v1 --replicas=0
    $ oc scale rc pipeline-edges-v1 --replicas=4
    ```

    You can see the pipeline pods are running and successful job.

    ```sh
    $ oc get pods
    NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    etcd-kbi4n                1/1       Running   0          1h
    pachd-z3b7y               1/1       Running   0          1h
    pipeline-edges-v1-28vdj   1/1       Running   0          12s
    pipeline-edges-v1-fpa8v   1/1       Running   0          12s
    pipeline-edges-v1-mshi0   1/1       Running   0          12s
    pipeline-edges-v1-yx2wa   1/1       Running   0          12s

    $ pachctl list job
    ID                                   OUTPUT COMMIT                          STARTED        DURATION   RESTART PROGRESS STATE
    1b2c1b49-f536-484f-b0e3-07b3906572be edges/006f0aecb2b048d5b5edee0cdb766879 55 minutes ago 51 minutes 0       1 / 1    success
    ```
